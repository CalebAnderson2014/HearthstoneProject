# HearthstoneProject

A simple excercise to play around with different technologies. Uses this great [API](http://hearthstoneapi.com/) to get card data for this pretty good game, [Hearthstone](http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/).

## Technologies

* Node
* Mongo w/ Mongoose
* Mocha/Chai
* React
* Probably some other stuff

## Goals
Eventually build a site that suggests cards to add to your deck based on what cards are already in it.
